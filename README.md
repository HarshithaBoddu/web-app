 ### INTRODUCTION: 

The main objective of our product is to reduce the spread of coronavirus as much as possible. Our product mainly consists of **Predictor with an Online Appointment booking System** and a tool called **Medicine Checker**.

### EXISTING SYSTEM: 

In the existing System, there is only an online Appointment Booking System available, in which anyone can book an appointment to meet the doctor. But at this time of pandemic it is not at all safe to continue with this existing system.
The frontline workers have been working selflessly though they are the most indispensable and the vulnerable section of the society. We have even seen cases where the doctors are being affected by COVID-19.

Not only the doctors who are treating the covid-19 patients, but also the other kind of doctors like Dentists, orthopedicians, gynecologists,etc.  are facing a problem to meet their patients. Because they might be thinking that the patient might be a Covid carrier and he might get affected by them, and in turn he will be meeting many other patients on the same day and this cycle goes on. Being a part of the sophisticated society it is our responsibility to come up with a new solution to reduce the speed of coronavirus and also to protect the doctors from this deadly disease.

You might ask us, What about the Virtual Treatments? 

We agree that Virtual treatments solve the problem, But not completely. In cases like Dental treatments, Orthopedic treatements , the patient has to go near the doctor to get themselves treated.

Our idea is a web application named **CARE4YOU** which consists of a predictor along with an online appointment booking system and a Medicine Checker. 

The tool **Covid Predictor** predicts the **Risk level of a person being affected by Covid-19**, taking into consideration some of the factors like Cold, Cough, Sore Throat etc. The risk level will be either predicted as **Low, Moderate or High**. The patients with risk level low and moderate will be able to book an appointment with their doctor but the patients with the high level will not be able to book an appointment but will be Guided to get tested at the nearest Covid-19 Test Centres .

To build the covid-19 predicted tool we have used a Machine Learning algorithm, **Random Forest algorithm** which gave us an **accuracy of 98%**.

We all know how important it is to procure the medicines at the right time and in the right quantity. The problem that we all must have faced during this pandemic situation is huge crowding near the medical shops. It is dangerous as we do not know the persons standing around us and we don't know the places they might have visited before. He might be a potential carrier of the virus. Assume that we took all the risks to stand in the long queue and finally it's our turn to buy the medicines, but the medicines we require are not available, then what? There is some sense of disappointment and frustration that sets in as humans. After all of this, we might have to go 10 different Pharmacies to get the medicine and again there might be some waiting time there as well. The solution that we propose is a Medicine Checker tool,  where one can sit at home and check for the availability of the medicines in the pharmacies near their location. 

The inputs that the user is required to give are:

* Name of the medicine.
* The quantity  in which it is required.
* Their location.
* The search radius. 

After the searching is done, they will be displayed with a list of pharmacies who have the medicines available in the required quantity, we can choose one of them and just go and collect the package and pay the amount. 

This solution solves the problems of Crowding at the Medical Shops in turn keeping us and others also safe from the spread of the Virus. We need not stand in long queues and don’t have to go to different places in search of the medicines.

- Technology required are : Machine learning algorithms :  Random Forest Classifier.
- Currently we have hosted our website using a free shared website hosting service (heroku). We are sure to host our website on a dedicated hosting service in future, as we progress.
- Programming language used : HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and PHP

### SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION :

The Direct users of the appointment booking system with the COVID-19 risk level predictor, are the doctors and the patients will be the indirect users of the product. Since the doctors are using it , their patients have to use it. 

The medicine checker will be used by the patients after visiting the doctors, it can also be used by the common people who take medicines on a regular basis.
